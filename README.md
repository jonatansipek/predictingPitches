Unlocking Shark Tank: Predicting pitch outcomes using a multimodal approach

In the dynamic and competitive landscape of technology and innovation, acquiring funding for a startup venture is a critical yet challenging endeavor. Funding success often hinges on effectively pitching a business idea to potential investors. Understanding the multimodal cues influencing investment decision-making can significantly enhance entrepreneurs' persuasive skills and provide valuable insights for investors and entrepreneurs. Previous research on predicting investment decisions in entrepreneurial pitches has primarily focused on unimodal behavioral cues, emphasizing vocal features. To address this gap, this study combines visual, verbal, and vocal cues with a unique emphasis on body language to predict pitch outcomes. By implementing a robust feature extraction framework for video data and utilizing interpretable machine learning models, this research aims to enhance the understanding of investor decision-making processes. Our findings indicate that a multimodal approach outperforms unimodal methods in predicting pitch success, although the overall prediction performance remains modest with an accuracy of 62,8% and an F1 Score of 0,77.
